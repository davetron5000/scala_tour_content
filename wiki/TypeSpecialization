This isn't covered by the tour.

h1. My Interpretation

Type Specialization is a feature that allows the Scala compiler to create type-specific versions of classes that take type parameters.  For example, if you have a collection of type <code>Collection[T]</code>, and you specialize <code>T</code>, the compiler will create not just one class, but one for each primitive type as well as for the object type.

This is entirely transparent to the programmer, and essentially is useful for optimizing code that is being slowed down by autoboxing.
