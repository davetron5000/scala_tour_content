Scala supports XML *literals*.  Meaning that this program:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/154847.js"></script>

outputs this:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/154848.js"></script>

This syntax can do more than just save you a few quotes and backslashes, however.  You can use curly braces to dynamically insert expressions, as such:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/154850.js"></script>

Note how we don't quote the @title@ or @href@ attributes; Scala knows that we are assigning XML attributes to dynamic variables (i.e. this isn't just blind templating; it's XML-aware).  Also note how the quoted string we pass to the function gets escaped inside the attribute value.
