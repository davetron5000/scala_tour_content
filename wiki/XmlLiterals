Scala supports XML *literals*.  Meaning that this program:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/154847.js"></script>

outputs this:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/154848.js"></script>

This syntax can do more than just save you a few quotes and backslashes, however.  You can use curly braces to dynamically insert expressions, as such:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/154850.js"></script>

Note how we don't quote the @title@ or @href@ attributes; Scala knows that we are assigning XML attributes to dynamic variables (i.e. this isn't just blind templating; it's XML-aware).  Also note how the quoted string we pass to the function gets escaped inside the attribute value.

Inside those curly braces, we can embed any Scala expression we want, so if we wanted to take a list and output it as a @ul@, this would work just fine:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/154851.js"></script>

Notice that inside our expression, we @map@ our list of strings to a list of XML literals, themselves containing a dynamic expression.

Also note that we can put literal curly braces in by either doubling them outside of an attribute, or quoting them as an attribute's value.
