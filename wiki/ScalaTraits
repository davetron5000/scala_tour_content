Scala doesn't have interfaces in the way that Java does; rather it uses Mixins (like Ruby), referred to as *Traits*.

A Trait is somewhat more similar to an abstract class in Java, except that in Scala, you can extend any number of traits that you wish.

Suppose our Circle class is getting refactored and enhanced.  We wish to make the @area@ method part of an interface that other shape classes might use.  Further, we wish to be able to compare circles based on their size.  In Java, we would implement the @Comparable@ interface and a new interface called something like @Area@.  

Now, further suppose that we want our comparison interface to be a bit richer than a simple @compareTo@ method that returns an int; we want to clearly test for "less than".  In Java, we would need to extend the @Comparable@ interface as so:

The problem is that the three new methods would have the exact same implementation in every case -- they'd use the @compareTo@ method.  If our class already extends another class, we're SOL.  Traits let us combine the concepts:

There is a lot more that can be done with traits (and several no-doubt better implementations of the "super comparable" concept), but this should demonstrate what Traits can do and why they are useful.
