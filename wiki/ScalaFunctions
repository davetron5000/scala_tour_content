Scala is more than just an object-oriented language with a compact syntax; it has extensive support for functional programming.  As such, methods can be passed around much as with C.

Any method you define can be passed as a parameter to another method.  Suppose we defined a @Person@ class, but don't want to commit to a name format.  We could make a @name@ method that takes, as an argument, a function that will turn a person's first and last names into a string:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/151041.js"></script>

This makes implementing the "template pattern":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern very straightforward.
