Scala is more than just an object-oriented language with a compact syntax; it has extensive support for functional programming.  As such, functions are first-class objects.

Suppose you have a list of U.S. States and wish to search by postal abbreviation.  In Java, you'd do something like this:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/152429.js"></script>

While this is reasonably clear, in Java you tend to write a lot of code like this, where you iterate over a list and "do something".  The main problem is that when you find out later you need to search by some other attribute, you write essentially the same looping and early-return structure.

Scala inverts this by allow you to pass in just the comparison function:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/152432.js"></script>

(The @getOrElse null@ is explained later; it simply lets you distinguish between finding or not finding the code)

The expression given to the @find@ method is a function literal, or *anonymous function*.  The argument to the @find@ method is declared to have the type @(A) => Boolean@, which is to say "A function that takes one argument, which has the type the same as the type of the list's elements, and returns a boolean."

In our case, since the list is a list of @State@ objects, the type of the function is @(State) => Boolean@.  Not that this entire expression is the type, the same as @int@ or @List<String>@ would be in Java.

That type is actually shorthand for @Function2[State,Boolean]@, where the method @apply@ is called when the function is called.  The Scala compiler translates the shorthand for you.

Further, you can pass functions around just like variables and other values.

A few more interesting things about functions in Scala:

* Methods of an object can be passed as functions
* Methods and functions **are not** the same thing

Functions, their definitions, and their behavior are a very deep subject, but this should give you a flavor of what they can do.  If you've done a lot of list manipulation (or Swing programming), you should be able to see that functions can save you from writing a ton of code...and result in much clearer code.
