Classes are defined much as they are in Java.  Here is a simple class that models a circle.

This is quite different from Java; it's much more compact, but it also gives you a tiny flavor of the functional side of Scala.  Notice how all the method definitions use the equals sign?  You are creating a sort-of expression for each one, but it's evaluated when you call the method.

This isn't a comprehensive overview of **everything** you can do, but gives you some of the flavor.

The @main@ method is tucked inside a ScalaObject, which is a sort of static singleton class.
