h1. The Gist

"Scala Operators":http://www.scala-lang.org/node/118 shows a very short example of creating "operator-like" method calls.

h1. My Interpretation

A method that takes one parameter can be used as if it were an operator, which is to say, without a dot or parenthesis.

Suppose you want to use Ruby's @<=>@ operator as a sorting mechanism.

<script src="http://gist.github.com/155984.js"></script>

Since Scala has very liberal rules about what can be in an identifier, you can make a method called @<=>@ and it works just fine.  The sort function could also be written like so:

pre. (a,b) => a.<=>(b)
