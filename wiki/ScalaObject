The Scala Tour doesn't officially call out this feature.

h1. My Interpretation

In Scala, classes have no static members (as they can in Java and Ruby).  Instead, Scala provides a means to create singleton objects.  These are, essentially, global variables.  However, by judicious use of naming, these objects can make your code more readable, especially with respect to [w:PatternMatching].
