h1. The Gist

The tour doesn't deal with exception handling directly.

h1. My Take

In Scala, there are no checked exceptions, but you can still handle them if you like.  This is done via the case statement and pattern matching:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/252529.js?file=Exceptions.scala"></script>

h1. My Thoughts on This Feature

Aside from the fact that you don't even have to handle exceptions explicitly, this syntax for doing so is much simpler and easier to deal with, IMO
