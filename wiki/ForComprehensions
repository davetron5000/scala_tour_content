"Sequence Comprehensions":http://www.scala-lang.org/node/131 describes Scala's for "loop"

h1. My Interpretation

You can read the "wikipedia entry on list comprehensions":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension if you like, but what we're talking about here is the many ways in which Scala allows you to traverse and process a list.

We've seen some of this in [w:ScalaFunctions] and [w:XmlLiterals], but these deal with more specific means of traversing a list (e.g. to @find@ a specific element or @map@ elements to other elements).  These are all specialized versions of the so-called "for-comprehension", which is a fancy name for a @for@ loop.

Suppose we have a list of U.S. States that have been tagged with their general location in the U.S. (e.g. "east" vs. "midwest" vs. "south").  Now suppose we wish to get a list of all the states that aren't on the east, except for Washington, DC, which, for some reason, we don't consider "east coast":

<script src="http://gist.github.com/154856.js"></script>

The expression @state <- states@ is a *generator*, which assigns a value from @states@ to the value @state@ in succession.  Each time this happens, the "guard condition" that starts with @if@ is evaluated.  If it evaluates to true (or if there is no guard condition), we "mark" this item for iteration.  Once the collection has been processed, we iterate over each "marked" item executing the body of the for-comprehension (this is the part that comes after the final paren).  In this case, we use the @yield@ keyword, which essentially means "yield this value back to the list we are creating".  Yes, we are creating a list, here.  The end result of this is a list of states that matched our guard condition.

Note the subtle difference here; in Java we would iterate over the entire collection; in Scala we are building up a collection over which to iterate via the guard condition and *then* executing the body of the for-comprehension.  This means that, in general, conditions inside the for-comprehension body cannot affect conditions in the guard condition:

pre.  var done = false
for (state <- states if !done) if state.code == 'DC' done = true

When we hit DC, we will *not* stop; this is because the guard condition has already been evaluated for every item in the list before we got to the body.  Yikes!  (See "this mind-blowing article":http://creativekarma.com/ee.php/weblog/comments/the_scala_for_comprehension_from_a_java_perspective/ on the crazy subtleties of the @for@ loop)

If we didn't want to actually yield a list, we can omit the @yield@ keyword alltogether:

pre.  for( state <- states if state.location != 'east || state.code == "DC") 
  println(state)

h2. Nested Loops

Instead of nesting @for@ loops, we can simply add expressions to the comprehension.  Suppose we wish to find pairs of states that could be "sister" states; states that aren't in the same geographic area.

pre.  val possibleSisters = for( state1 <- states; 
state2 <- states 
if state1.location != state2.location) 
  yield (state1,state2)

Here, we loop through each pair of states, yield a tuple of states that don't have the same @location@.

h2. What about @map@, @filter@, etc.?

In reality, the @for@ comprehensions are translated by the compiler into calls to @map@, @filter@, and @flatMap@.  Section 10.3 of "Scala By Example":http://www.scala-lang.org/sites/default/files/linuxsoft_archives/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf details this.

h1. My Thoughts on this Feature

I thought I understood this feature until I read "this  article":http://creativekarma.com/ee.php/weblog/comments/the_scala_for_comprehension_from_a_java_perspective/ .  Now, I'm a bit lost, mostly as to *why* it works this way.  Perhaps the name @for@ is misleading; in most programming languages, @for@ means "do something for everything in the list".  I guess the definition of the "list" is what's unclear.  I find it hard to know what a particular @for@ statement in Scala will actually *do*.  That doesn't seem good.

I suppose once I've internalized how it works, it will seem more obvious.
