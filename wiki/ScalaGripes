* In general, the collections operations seem odd in their omissions; why does @indexOf@ not take a function?
* The scaladoc *really* sucks; very hard to navigate and the explanations are terse, to say the least.
* method names are throwbacks to C-style, e.g. @mkString@.  Lame
* With all the symbol-soup...no ternary operator?!?!
* Why isn't comparison done with @<=>@?
* Why do I need parens around @if@ statements *except* when used as guard conditions?!
* What's up with the right-associative colon nonsense?
* Have to use @_=@ is LAME.  Not being able to make methods like @active?@ is LAME.  If we're gonna have wild-west operator Ã¼berload, let's just f'ing do it all the way.
