* What is the Scala equivalent of @array.sort {|a,b| a<=> b}@?  Why is there no sort on @Array@?
* In general, the collections operations seem odd in their omissions; why does @indexOf@ not take a function?
* The scaladoc *really* sucks; very hard to navigate and the explanations are terse, to say the least.
* method names are throwback's to C-style, e.g. @mkString@.  Lame
* With all the symbol-soup...no ternary operator?!?!
